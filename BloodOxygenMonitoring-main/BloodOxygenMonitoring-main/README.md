This project is a web application designed to monitor blood oxygen levels, implementing an Express.js server with MongoDB for data management.

## Features

- Secure HTTPS connections.
- CORS enabled for cross-origin resource sharing.
- RESTful API endpoints to manage patients and physicians data.
- Real-time blood oxygen level monitoring and data visualization (frontend implementation details not provided).

## Installation

### Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/kANNISTER/BloodOxygenMonitoring.git

cd BloodOxygenMonitoring

Install dependencies:
npm install

Set up MongoDB
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your system. Connect to your MongoDB instance:

Configure HTTPS
Place your SSL certificate and private key in the respective directories and update the file paths in app.js if necessary.
